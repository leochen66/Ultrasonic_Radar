# Ultrasonic_Radar

## Overview
We designed a device to educate the public and raise awareness about climate change and carbon emission. It uses ultrasonic distance sensors and three rings of LED lights controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. The sensors detect the distance between the users and the device, triggering changes in the LED patterns to alert the public about the urgent issue of climate change.

## Box modeling
We used laser cutting on 6 mm MDF to shape a box. To assemble all the pieces, we designed joints on each piece, as shown in Figure 2. The unique feature of this box is the middle layer, which holds the LED strip and conceals all electronic components, avoiding them being seen through the clear lid. This layer also prevents directly gluing the LED strip to the lid, which would negatively impact the aesthetics and make maintenance difficult.
